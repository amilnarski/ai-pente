##Description

##Summary of Existing Work
Pente has been the subject of a surprising amount of AI work. The earliest mention was a 1986 article where a computer player used a weighted table to determine its next move [1]. The table itself was not static, and the player could update its table based on the moves that its opponent made in response. This update between observed results and a prediction is reminiscent of a primitive reinforcement learner. More recent work has been done which implements more advanced players in various languages. An analysis of players suggests that Negascout and AlphaBeta provide the best results out of the players that were implemented (others include SSS-2, MTD-f, and AlphaBeta with transposition table) [2].
